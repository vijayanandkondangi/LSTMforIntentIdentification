# Bi-directional LSTM based RNN for Intent Identification

This notebook is to illustrate the use of bi-directional LSTM based RNNs for intent identification from text.

The NN is trained on a very very few samples and still exhibited remarkable accuracy.

This architecture with a few modifications can be used to address the Intent Identification step of closed domain chatbots.
